# I2C Pullup Breakout

![](I2CPullup_Image.jpg)

## Purpose

Prototyping aid that allows selectable pull-up and series resistors for the I2C
bus. To use, just insert the module into your circuit/breadboard and select the
appropriate series/pull up resistor values with the solder  jumpers. Bridging
the jumpers is very easy and switching usually just requires a swipe with the
soldering iron.
